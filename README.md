# My DOOM Emacs Configuration

This is an editor configuration I've built up over the years. It works well on both Linux and Mac operating systems with
Emacs installed.

# Installation
1. Install [DOOM Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)
2. Clone this repository into your `~/.doom.d` directory.
3. Run `doom sync` to install the packages and update your configuration.
